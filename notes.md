Things that aren't declaratively managed on my system at this point:
- Catppuccin Typst theme does not seem to exist on Typst Universe anymore, so I've cloned the repository to `~/.local/share/typst/packages/local/catppuccin/1.0.0`
- Firefox is not done declaratively (extensions wise)
- Background image is not done declaratively
